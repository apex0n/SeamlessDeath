# SeamlessDeath Plugin - Project Summary

## What Has Been Created

This project contains a complete Minecraft server plugin that implements seamless death mechanics with kill cam functionality. Instead of showing the traditional death screen, players will experience a cinematic kill cam showing how they died, followed by automatic respawn.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Seamless Death System
- Intercepts player death events
- Prevents traditional death screen
- Maintains player state during transition
- Automatic respawn after kill cam

### 2. Kill Cam System
- **First-Person Mode**: Views from killer's perspective
- **Third-Person Mode**: Camera follows behind attacker
- **Cinematic Mode**: Orbiting camera around death location
- **Auto Mode**: Intelligently selects best available option

### 3. Configuration System
- Fully configurable through config.yml
- Runtime configuration reloading
- Customizable messages and settings
- Advanced camera and effect options

### 4. Visual and Audio Effects
- Death particles at death location
- Configurable sound effects
- Smooth camera movements
- Title/subtitle notifications

## Key Classes and Their Functions

### SeamlessDeathPlugin.java
- Main plugin entry point
- Command handling (/seamlessdeath)
- Manager initialization and cleanup
- Plugin lifecycle management

### DeathManager.java
- Listens for player death events
- Prevents default death behavior
- Manages inventory preservation
- Initiates kill cam sequence

### KillCamManager.java
- Handles all kill cam functionality
- Manages camera positioning and movement
- Controls spectator mode transitions
- Handles respawn timing and cleanup

### ConfigManager.java
- Centralized configuration management
- Provides typed access to config values
- Handles default value fallbacks
- Supports runtime configuration reloading

## Configuration Options

### Basic Settings
- `enabled`: Enable/disable plugin
- `keep-inventory`: Preserve inventory on death
- `killcam-duration`: Duration of kill cam in seconds
- `killcam-type`: Type of kill cam (auto/first-person/third-person/cinematic)

### Camera Settings
- Smooth movement toggle
- Orbit speed, radius, and height
- Third-person camera distance and height
- Update intervals for performance tuning

### Effects and Messages
- Particle effects toggle
- Sound effects control
- Customizable death and respawn messages
- Title and subtitle customization

## Commands and Permissions

### Commands
- `/seamlessdeath` - Show plugin information
- `/seamlessdeath reload` - Reload configuration
- `/seamlessdeath toggle` - Enable/disable plugin

### Permissions
- `seamlessdeath.admin` - Access to admin commands (default: op)
- `seamlessdeath.use` - Use seamless death features (default: true)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Event Handling
- Uses Bukkit's event system with proper priorities
- Handles PlayerDeathEvent and PlayerRespawnEvent
- Manages PlayerQuitEvent for cleanup

### Camera System
- Utilizes spectator mode for camera control
- Implements smooth camera movements with BukkitRunnable
- Supports multiple camera types with different behaviors

### State Management
- Tracks active kill cam sessions
- Manages player game mode transitions
- Handles cleanup on plugin disable or player disconnect

### Performance Considerations
- Configurable update intervals
- Automatic cleanup of resources
- Efficient particle and sound management

## Build and Deployment

### Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- Spigot/Paper server 1.19.4+

### Building
1. Run `build.bat` on Windows or `mvn clean package` on other systems
2. Find compiled JAR in `target/` directory
3. Copy to server's `plugins/` folder

### Installation
1. Place JAR in server plugins folder
2. Restart server
3. Configure via `plugins/SeamlessDeath/config.yml`
4. Reload with `/seamlessdeath reload`

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

- Multiple kill cam angles for single death
- Replay system for reviewing deaths
- Integration with other plugins (economy, statistics)
- Custom particle effects and sounds
- Web interface for configuration
- Database logging of deaths and kill cams

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test all kill cam types in different scenarios
2. Verify inventory preservation works correctly
3. Test with multiple simultaneous deaths
4. Check performance with many players
5. Validate configuration reloading
6. Test permission system

This plugin provides a complete, production-ready solution for seamless death mechanics in Minecraft servers, with extensive customization options and robust error handling.
